This extension enhances the page model with tagging capabilities, tagging as in "2.0" and tagclouds.

== Requirements

This extension depends on the shards extension and the has_many_polymorphs plugin (included in the extension)
Shards should be installed and loaded first; you can change the load order of extensions in config/environment.rb (see http://wiki.radiantcms.org/Using_the_Shards_Extension).

== Installation

1. Copy the extension to your vendor/extensions directory as you would any other extension.
2. Run 'rake radiant:extensions:tags:install'
3. Make a page to sit in /search/by-tag, and give it the "Tag Search" pagetype.
	If you want to change this location, it's in Radiant::Config['tags.results_page_url'].
